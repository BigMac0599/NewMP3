Question 1:
The type of smell presented in this problem is Duplicated Code, which happens when identical code exists in more than one place. It can be fixed by using a function call

Question 3:
The code smell in this problm is known as "Inappropriate Intimacy", where one class uses internal methods and fields of another class. The solution would be to move the methods to the appropriate class

Question 6:
There was an instance of copy and paste in hudson.model.ProjectTest.java
The following code was inserted twice at lines 


        try{
            project.doEnable();
            fail("User should not have permission to build project");
        }
        catch(Exception e){
            if(!(e.getClass().isAssignableFrom(AccessDeniedException2.class))){
               fail("AccessDeniedException should be thrown.");
            }
        } 
        auth.add(Job.READ, user.getId());
        auth.add(Job.CONFIGURE, user.getId());
        auth.add(Jenkins.READ, user.getId());
        List<HtmlForm> forms = j.createWebClient().login(user.getId(), "password").goTo(project.getUrl()).getForms();
        for(HtmlForm form:forms){
            if("enable".equals(form.getAttribute("action"))){
                j.submit(form);
            }
        }

To fix this duplicate code smell, we can simply extract them into a function. Then we can replace all the instances of this code snippet with the function
